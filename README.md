Batch Clipboard is a menu bar utility for macOS that adds the ability to copy multiple
items and then paste them in order elsewhere.

### About

Batch Clipboard is a fork of clipboard manager [Maccy](https://maccy.app) and it's aim
isn't to have all the capabilities of a full-featured clipboard history manager,
but to provide just this single multi-clipboard feature:

<kbd>CONTROL (^)</kbd> + <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
to copy as many items as you like from a source document, then
<kbd>CONTROL (^)</kbd> + <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>,
then to paste each item in same order in your target document.

[Full documentation is here](https://batchclipboard.bananameter.lol).

### Install

Download the latest version from the
[releases](https://github.com/jpmhouston/Cleepp/releases/latest) page,
or the Mac App Store.

_For the time being, macOS will report that pre-release builds of Batch Clipboard are
unsigned and refuse to open normally. To launch the first time you may
need to right-click / control-click on the app icon and choose Open from the
contextual menu._

The Mac App Store version, when available, will provide a few bonus features
via an in-app purchase, but otherwise operates the same as the
direct download version.

Batch Clipboard is built to run optimally on both Intel and Apple Silicon, and is intended
to work on systems as old as 2018's macOS Mojave 10.14, however runs best
on the latest, macOS 14 Sonoma.
_Beta testers are needed to validate correct operation on those older systems,
please [download](https://github.com/jpmhouston/Cleepp/releases/latest) a pre-release build and report any issues to
[batchclip.support@bananameter.lol](mailto:batchclip.support@bananameter.lol)._
