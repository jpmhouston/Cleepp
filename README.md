Cleepp is a menu bar utility for macOS that adds the ability to copy multiple items
and then paste them in order elsewhere.

### About

Cleepp is a fork of clipboard manager [Maccy](https://maccy.app); it's aim isn't to have
all the features of a full features clipboard history manager, but to provide just this single
multi-clipboard feature:

<kbd>CONTROL (^)</kbd> + <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
to copy as many items as you like from a source document, then
<kbd>CONTROL (^)</kbd> + <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>,
then to paste each item in same order in your target document.

[Full documentation is here](https://github.com/jpmhouston/Cleepp/wiki/About-Cleepp-for-macOS).

### Install

Download the latest version from the
[releases](https://github.com/jpmhouston/Cleepp/releases/latest) page,
